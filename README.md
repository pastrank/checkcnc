# checkcnc
A simple analyzer for Auton cnc files processed for Heidenhein controllers.

It's unuseful for all, except for guys that are using Heidenhein cnc controllers (like me, on an Agie V500 and a Vx Pro 800). Doing copper electrodes (and have a similar output of the cam postprocessor). I need to change often the ops in the tools tree, I would to control if I've done all the required changes.
